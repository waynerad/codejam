This repository has my solutions to Google Code Jam problems. See https://code.google.com/codejam/ for all the info about Google Code Jam. In short, Code Jam is the world's biggest (and most difficult) programming competition. I've done it every year since 2008, but I didn't think to put my code here until 2017, so if older code is missing, that's the reason why. I use Golang as the programming language; starting in 2012 or 13, I switched from Python to Go.
